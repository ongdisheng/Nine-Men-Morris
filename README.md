# Nine-Men-Morris

## Introduction
This repository contains a Java implementation of the Nine Men's Morris game, developed using IntelliJ and Java Swing library.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to create a fully functional Nine Men's Morris game using an object-oriented approach. The application incorporates a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in order to promote a well-organized design with clear separation of concerns and minimal interdependence between components. At the same time, this project harnesses the power of design patterns such as observer and command pattern, while upholding the SOLID object-oriented principles to establish a scalable architecture that simplifies feature integration and guarantees long-term maintainability of the codebase.
