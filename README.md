# Nine-Men-Morris

## Introduction
This repository contains a Java implementation of the Nine Men's Morris game, developed using IntelliJ and Java Swing library.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to create a fully functional Nine Men's Morris game using an object-oriented approach. The application incorporates a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in order to promote a well-organized design with clear separation of concerns and minimal interdependence between components. This project also harnesses the power of design patterns such as the observer and command pattern, while upholding the SOLID object-oriented principles to establish a scalable architecture that simplifies feature integration and guarantees long-term maintainability of the codebase. 

## Code Execution
To run the code in this repository, kindly follow one of the following options:
1. **Run project.jar file:**
   
     - Navigate to the src folder
     - Execute the `project.jar` file to launch the game application
   
2. **Alternative Method:**

     - Open the project in IntelliJ
     - Locate the `Application.java` file in the project structure
     - Right-click on the `Application` class and select "Run" from the context menu to start the game
